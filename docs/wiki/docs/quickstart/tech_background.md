## Technical Background

## What is DePHY Network

Decentralized low-latency off-chain network for DePIN with verifiability and composability

### Why Web3 needs real-world

- The physical and blockchain worlds exist as separate entities, yet thereâ€™s a critical interplace between them

- The virtual world needs real input
    - The evolving landscape of software development is increasingly focused on creating applications that address real-world challenges
    - A significant void exists in Web3 regarding authentic data sources that reflect real-world dynamics
    - This disparity between the demand for real-world integrations and the current offerings in the Web3 space highlights a pressing need for bridging these two realms
- Revolutionizing economics through digital integration:
    - Historically, translating real-world actions into valuable digital assets or incentives has been a slow and complex process.
    - The prevailing trend of data monopolization by centralized entities (often large corporations) underscores the need for a new economic model that leverages decentralized technologies.

## How does DePHY work?

- DID of DePIN Devices
    - Unique Key Pairs for Each Device: Every DePHY device is assigned a distinct and permanent pair of keys, ensuring a secure and unique digital identity.
    - Blockchain Integration for Identity Verification: On the blockchain, each device is linked to a specific token. This token is crucial for confirming the device's identity and authenticating its communications with the blockchain network.

- Decentralized DePIN Network Operating Off-Chain
    - MQTT Protocol for Streamlined Communication: The network leverages the MQTT protocol, widely recognized in the IoT industry, to facilitate device communication. This choice significantly eases integration challenges and minimizes hardware demands.

    - NoStr Protocol for Enhanced Networking: To meet the low latency demands of IoT, DePHY utilizes the NoStr protocol. This enables the network to achieve decentralization, flexible connectivity, effective message filtration and prepares the ground for incorporating payment systems in the future.

    - Diverse Nodes for a Robust Network: The network's backbone is formed by "Archive Nodes." DePHY permits the integration of nodes serving various roles, such as data visualization, IoT device gateways, data oracles, and analytics, broadening the network's functionality.

- Through data Oracle network nodes, data reported by DePIN devices can be submitted to the blockchain. Its validity can be verified through DePIN DID.
