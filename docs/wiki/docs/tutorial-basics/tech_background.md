# Tech Background

## The intersection of Web3 and the Real-World

While there has historically been a large gap between the real world and blockchain, this gap is quickly closing as the world’s craving for real time, verifiable and accurate data grows rapidly by the day

- The evolving landscape of software development is increasingly focused on creating applications that address real-world challenges and require enormous data sets

- A significant void exists in Web3 regarding authentic data sources that reflect real-world dynamics

Revolutionizing Data Economies through digital integrations:

- Historically, translating real-world actions into valuable digital assets or incentives has been a slow and complex process

- The prevailing trend of data monopolization by centralized entities (often large corporations) underscores the need for a new economic model that leverages decentralized technologies, allowing individuals to maintain ownership of their data

## What is DePHY Network

The DePHY Network is a decentralized low-latency off-chain network for DePIN, ensuring verifiability and composability of user data. DePHY aims to make launching DePIN projects as easy, cheap and efficient as possible through open-source hardware solutions and a messaging layer utilizing Decentralized Identifiers to connect DePIN devices to the blockchain.

## How does DePHY work?

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a unique identifier that can be issued by a decentralized platform. This identifier acts as proof of ownership of digital identities. Unlike traditional identifiers that require a centralized registration authority, DIDs are universally unique identifiers (UUID) that are cryptographically verifiable. They can be used to **identify individuals**, **organizations**, **abstract entities**, **data models**, and **Internet of Things (IoT)** devices.

- Unique Key Pairs for Each Device: Every DePHY device is assigned a distinct and permanent pair of keys, ensuring a secure and unique digital identity

- Blockchain Integration for Identity Verification: On the blockchain, each device is linked to a specific token. This token is crucial for confirming the device's identity and authenticating its communications with the blockchain network

DePHY’s Decentralized DePIN Network operates Off-Chain and uses Data Oracle network nodes to allow for data collected by DePIN devices to be submitted to the blockchain and verified through DePIN DIDs.

- MQTT Protocol for Streamlined Communication: The network leverages the MQTT protocol, widely recognized in the IoT industry, to facilitate device communication which significantly eases integration challenges and minimizes hardware demands.

- NoStr Protocol for Enhanced Networking: To meet the low latency demands of IoT, DePHY utilizes the NoStr protocol which enables the network to achieve decentralization, flexible connectivity, effective message filtration and prepares the ground for incorporating payment systems in the future

- Diverse Nodes for a Robust Network: The network's backbone is formed by "Archive Nodes” and DePHY permits the integration of nodes serving various roles, such as data visualization, IoT device gateways, data oracles, and analytics, broadening the network's functionality

Restaking services powered by companies such as Solayer or Jito, allows DePHY’s network to leverage already staked cryptocurrencies to support additional security and operations across multiple platforms.

- Traditionally users can stake SOL in a wallet like Phantom, where assets are locked in a single protocol which maintains the network’s integrity and allows users to earn rewards

- Restaking allows assets to do more work and allows staked Sol to contribute to the security of various decentralized applications (dApps) without relinquishing original staking benefits.

- Restaking on Solana involves intricate mechanisms that enhance both the asset’s utility and its earning potential by allowing Validators to utilize a portion of their staked SOL to secure more protocols
